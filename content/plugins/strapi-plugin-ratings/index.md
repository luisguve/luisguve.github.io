[Ratings](https://npmjs.com/package/strapi-plugin-ratings) is a Strapi plugin that allows your users to post reviews.

Enable and manage user reviews for your content very easily!

### Requirements

You should have installed an instance of Strapi v4.x.x

### Installation

Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
npm install strapi-plugin-ratings
```

Then, rebuild the admin dashboard using the following command

```bash
npm run build
```

### Configurarion

For your frontend to have access to the API, enable the following permissions for **Ratings** from **Users & Permissions Plugin** on your project settings:

For public, enable: **count**, **find**, **getPageSize** and **getStats**.

For authenticated, enable **create**, **find** and **getUserReview**.

### Display user reviews on the frontend

Reviews can be displayed in the frontend in two ways:

1. Using the React components library [strapi-ratings-client](https://npmjs.com/package/strapi-ratings-client) **(recommended)**
2. Build your custom frontend using the API endpoints, described as follows:

### API

There are some Typescript interfaces that will help to get an idea of the data structures.

##### Reviews:

```ts
interface IReview {
  id: number,
  createdAt: string,
  comment: string | null,
  author: IAuthor | null,
  score: number,
}
```

##### Authors:

```ts
interface IAuthor {
  username: string,
  email: string,
  id: number
}
```

##### Content Stats

```ts
interface IStats {
  averageScore: number;
  reviewsCount: number | null;
}
```

The following endpoints are exposed to fetch and post reviews:

##### Get reviews for a content ID

**Method**: GET

**Path**: /api/ratings/reviews/:slug

**Optional query parameters**: start, ignoreCount

**Returns**:

```ts
{
  reviewsCount: number,
  averageScore: number,
  userReview: IReview | null,
  reviews: IReview[]
}
```

The parameter `start` indicates how many reviews to skip. This is for pagination purposes.

The parameter `ignoreCount` indicates whether or not to return the total number of reviews associated with the given slug.

##### Get review stats for a content ID

**Method**: GET

**Path**: /api/ratings/reviews/:slug/stats

**Returns**:

```ts
{
  averageScore: number,
  reviewsCount: number | null
}
```

---

##### Get the number of reviews associated with a given content ID

**Method**: GET

**Path**: /api/ratings/reviews/:slug/count

**Returns**:

```ts
{
  count: number
}
```

---

##### Post a review

**Method**: POST

**Path**: /api/ratings/reviews/:slug

**Authentication**: Bearer token

**Payload**:

```ts
{
  content: string
}
```

**Returns**:

```ts
{
  id: number
}
```

By default, every authenticated user can post reviews on any content.

In order to customize this behavior, e.g. allowing or disallowing a user from posting reviews, you must **extend** the service `userCanPostReview` from whithin `register` function in ./src/index.js. For example:

```js
strapi.service("plugin::ratings.review").userCanPostReview = async (user, slug) => {
  /*
    Here you will check whether or not the user
    is allowed to post a review on this content ID
    and return either true or false.
  */
  return true
}
```

Notice that `userCanPostReview` will receive two parameters: the `user` from `Users & Permissions Plugin`, containing it's id, username, confirmed, etc., and the `slug`, which is a string and refers to the content ID which the review is being posted on.

In case this function returns `false`, the response of the endpoint will be 403 (forbidden) with the text `User cannot post a review on this content`.

##### Get the page size

**Method**: GET

**Path**: /api/ratings/page-size

**Returns**:

```ts
{
  pageSize: number
}
```

---

### General settings

The plugin allows to set how many reviews are returned per page by going to the **Pagination** section under **Ratings Plugin** of the **Settings** section.

The default page size is 10.

### Management of reviews

Admin users are able to delete reviews from within the plugin page of the Strapi admin dashboard.

The plugin interface has two tabs: one for the latest reviews and one for reviews by content ID.

### Roadmap and future plans

The plugin is pretty basic but it can be improved with more features and a better UI/UX. Collaborations and suggestions are very welcome.
