I'm a software developer focused on web and mobile technologies. I have built some projects with **Strapi, React, React Native and Typescript**, among which an e-learning platform and a SaaS for private transport companies stand out.

The one thing that I like the most in this profession is bugs. I really enjoy fixing them because they force me to think about the different pieces working together as a whole. At the end of the day, that's the reason why I love this job.

In 2018, I started my journey as a software developer learning Golang, just enough SQL to get a database up and running and Javascript, building simple and fun projects. I then discovered React and Typescript, and they significantly improved my ability to build web apps faster.

I have also built and maintained a couple of projects in VueJS and I consider it an excellent alternative to React. It is so joyful to work on Vue projects!

However, as I have much more experience working in React projects from scratch, **my first choice when deciding what framework to use to build my next frontend is NextJS.**

Regarding mobile development, React Native is the best option as of now in my opinion, and because it uses React under the hood, it is so convenient for us React frontend developers.
