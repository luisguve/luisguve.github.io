In 2018 I started my journey as a software developer learning Golang and Javascript, building simple and fun projects. Then I found out React and Typescript and it improved my ability to build web apps faster significantly.

I also built a couple of projects in VueJS and I consider it an excellent alternative to React. It is so joyful to work on Vue projects! However, when it comes to mobile development, React Native is the best option as of now in my opinion, so my first choice when deciding what framework to use to build my next frontend is React.

As of the backend development, I always stick with Strapi as it provides a really nice developer experience for building MVPs, and this blog will have a lot of content related to this CMS.
